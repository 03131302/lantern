Todo:
* wildcards, in sig gen, sig checking
* Private key file parsing use io.Reader (or the like) - NewReader, NewWriter?
* IP6 testing - in resolver and also in responder code
        extend Responder interface with ipv6?
* Test impl of nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online  signing
* NSEC and nsec3 closest encloser helper functions
* Tsig generation for replies (request MAC)
* pack/Unpack smaller. EDNS 'n stuff can be folded in
* server: don't need the interfaces only functions
* server: client must setup listener and give that to Serve

Longer term:
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and own lexer
* Multi line output?

Issues:
* escaped dots in names \.
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maybe net issue)
* Convenience functions? Not sure if I want them??
    - NXDomain pkt
    - FormErr pkt
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate

Funkensturm:
* use exp/eval - to inteprete the config file??
* TCP how to handle stuff like AXFR
* use package log
