Guidelines for the API:

o symmetrical, client side stuff should be mirrored in the server stuff
o clean, small API
o fast data structures (rb-tree, when they come available)
o api-use should lead to self documenting code

o zone structure -- only as rb-tree 
o compression (only ownernames?)

o Key2DS, also for offline keys -- need to parse them ofcourse

o Tsig will probably become an interface which has all configuration
  stuff, but this will come later. Config which has Tsig function

Todo:
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and .cz lexer?
* encoding NSEC3/NSEC bitmaps, DEcoding works
* HIP RR (needs list of domain names, need slice stuff for that)
* Is subdomain, is glue helper functions for this kind of stuff

Issues:
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel??
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* pack/Unpack smaller. EDNS 'n stuff can be folded in
* SetDefaults() for *all* types?

Examples:
* Test impl of nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online  signing
