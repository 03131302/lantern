Todo:
Short term:
* NSEC3 - need base32 for Nsec3
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and own lexer
    -- develop this is own package, then fold back to dns package
* private key to privkey format 1.3, io.Writer kind of stuff
* Signature generation
* Testsuite - make it slightly better
* Cleanup the code

Issues:
* escaped dots in names \.
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Better sized buffers
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maybe net issue)
* Convenience functions?
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate
    - printing??
* query-time, server in string ouput of dns.Msg
   - resolver.Msg when doing resolver querying, extend msg...?
* remove the dns.Wire*() functions and fixe dnssec.go to make it work
* Fix remaining records: LOC, NAPTR, ..., ...

Port over from LDNS:
* ldns-keygen
