Todo:
Short term:
* NSEC3 - need base32 for Nsec3
* Parsing from strings
* Signature generation
* Testsuite
* Cleanup the code

Issues:
* escaped dots in names \.
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Better sized buffers
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maybe net issue)
* Convenience functions?
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate
* query-time, server in string ouput of dns.Msg
   - DnsMsg when doing resolver querying, extend msg...?
   -- 
* remove the dns.Wire*() functions
* Fix remaining records: LOC, NAPTR 'n stuff. Checkit

Port over from LDNS:
* ldns-rrsig
* ldns-keygen - generate a key - more server side
