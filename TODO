Todo:
Short term:
* fix os.Erros usage, add DNSSEC related errors
* DNSSEC validation
* NSEC(3) secure denial of existence, support the type bitmap
* TKEY -- RFC 2930
* TSIG -- RFC 4635
Long term:
* IDN?
* Unknown RRs?
* Parsing from strings
* Server support (signing, receiving queries)
* Key generation

Issues:
* Better sized buffers
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maby net issue)
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Convience functions?
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate
    - notify
* query-time, server in string ouput of dns.Msg
   - DnsMsg when doing resolver querying

Port over from LDNS:
* ldns-notify
* ldns-rrsig
* ldns-keygen - generate a key - more server side
