Issues:
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel??
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* pack/Unpack smaller. EDNS 'n stuff can be folded in???
* Compression. Take stuff from Jan Mercl

Todo:
* encoding NSEC3/NSEC bitmaps, DEcoding works
* HIP RR (needs list of domain names, need slice stuff for that)
* Is subdomain, is glue helper functions for this kind of stuff
* Cleanups

Examples:
* Test impl of nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online  signing
