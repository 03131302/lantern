Todo:
Short term:
* NSEC3 - need base32 for Nsec3
* Cleanup the code
* Tsig testing
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and own lexer

Issues:
* escaped dots in names \.
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Better sized buffers
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maybe net issue)
* Convenience functions?
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate
    - printing??
* query-time, server in string ouput of resolver.Msg
   - resolver.Msg when doing resolver querying, extend msg...?
* Fix remaining records: LOC, NAPTR, ..., ...
