Todo:
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and .cz lexer?
* encoding NSEC3/NSEC bitmaps, DEcoding works
* HIP RR (needs list of domain names, need slice stuff for that)

Issues:
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel??
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* pack/Unpack smaller. EDNS 'n stuff can be folded in
* SetDefaults() for *all* types?
* Closing of tcp connections?

* Refacter the IXFR/AXFR/TSIG code

Examples:
* Test impl of nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online  signing
