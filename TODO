Todo:
* NSEC and nsec3 closest encloser helper functions
* os.Error in Pack()/Unpack()
* wildcards
* Tsig testing
* Private key file parsing use io.Reader (or the like)
* Parsing from /etc/resolv.conf - clean up the code, use normal packages
* IP6 testing - in resolver and also in responder code
        extend Responder interface with ipv6?
* Test impl of nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online  signing
* NSEC3 - need base32 for Nsec3
* pkt log
* error when you cannot connect (responder)
* Tsig function need to be methods on *dns.Msg (much more natural)

Longer term:
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and own lexer
* Multi line output?

Issues:
* make TCP UDP naming more in line with the net package i.e. prefix instead of postfix
* escaped dots in names \.
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Better sized buffers
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maybe net issue)
* Convenience functions? Not sure if I want them??
    - NXDomain pkt
    - FormErr pkt
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate

Funkensturm:
* add some generic functions that can be used
    matching functions should be go-like and just hook into the exported
    field from package dns.
    actions are defined in calling functions from funkensturm:
        - sign(RRSET, privKEY), how do you specify WHAT gets signed
            if rr.Header().Name == "miek.nl." -> sign header -> add sig
* use exp/eval - to inteprete the config file??
* TCP how to handle stuff like AXFR
* use package log
