Todo:
* NSEC3 - need base32 for Nsec3
* Tsig testing
* Private key file parsing use io.Reader (or the like)
* Parsing from /etc/resolv.conf - clean up the code, use normal packages

Longer term:
* Parsing from strings, going with goyacc and own lexer
* Multi line output?

Issues:
* escaped dots in names \.
* quoted quotes in txt records
* Better sized buffers
* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel
* Make the testsuite work with public DNS servers
* shortened ipv6 addresses are not parsed correctly (maybe net issue)
* Convenience functions? Not sure if I want them??
    - NXDomain pkt
    - FormErr pkt
    - for new(RR*)
    - nsupdate
* query-time, server in string ouput of resolver.Msg
   - resolver.Msg when doing resolver querying, extend msg...?
   - also for the server?
* Fix remaining records: LOC and others
