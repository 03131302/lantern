# TODO

* outgoing [AI]xfr
* fix 'q' standardize ipv6 input with [::1]#53 ?
* use function callback with {}interface...  for async querying...?
* Fix tsig and Exchange*() 
* Splitoff fksd

## Nice to have

* Speed, we can always go faster. A simple reflect server now hits 35/45K qps
* go test; only works correct on my machine
* privatekey.Precompute() when signing?
