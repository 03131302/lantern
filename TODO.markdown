# TODO

Must of the stuff is working, but there is a list of smaller things that
need to be fixed.

* Speed, we can always go faster. A simple reflect server now hits 35/45K qps
* Find a way to implement tsig and/or ip blocking for queries and transfers
   this must work on the client side and in the server side
* go test; only works correct on my machine
* Add handy zone data structure (r/b tree)? Or not...
* Query source address?

* NSECx bitmap length
  array of 256 block lens set to 0. scan RRs, save highest RR / 8 in
  each block. len is 2 * # non-0 blocks + sum block len
  We now allocate 32 bytes for each nsec3 seen

* Add TsigStatus to *Msg?
  
## Examples to add

* Nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online signing;
* Recursor - ala FunkenSturm?
