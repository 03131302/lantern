# TODO

* Support for on-the-fly-signing or check how to do it
* Ratelimiting? server side (RRL)

## Nice to have

* Speed, we can always go faster. A simple reflect server now hits 75/80K qps on
    moderate hardware
* privatekey.Precompute() when signing?

## RRs not implemented

These are deprecated, or rarely used (or just a bitch to implement).
