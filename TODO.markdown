# TODO

* Support for on-the-fly-signing or check how to do it
* Ratelimiting? server side (RRL)

## Nice to have

* Speed, we can always go faster. A simple reflect server now hits 75/80K qps on
    moderate hardware
* privatekey.Precompute() when signing?
* Last remaining RRs: NIMLOC & EID, ATMA, A6, KEY, SIG and NXT
