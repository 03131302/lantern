# TODO

* outgoing [AI]xfr
* zonereader that extracts glue (or at least signals it) and other usefull stuff?
* complete resolver

## Nice to have

* Speed, we can always go faster. A simple reflect server now hits 35/45K qps
* go test; only works correct on my machine
* privatekey.Precompute() when signing? 

## Examples to add

* Nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online signing;
* Recursor - ala FunkenSturm?
