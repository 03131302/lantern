Alternative (more granular) approach to a DNS library.

Completely usable as a DNS client library. Most widely used Resource
Records are supported. DNSSEC types are too (except NSEC/NSEC3). EDNS0
is supported (see edns.go).

Sample programs can be found in the examples directory.

Have fun!

Implemented RFCS:

* RFC2671, EDNS
* RFC1034/1035
* RFC4033/4034/4035 
* RFC5155 (NSEC3)

Loosely based upon:
* ldns
* NSD
* Net::DNS
