Alternative aproach to a DNS library

Much more control as you prepare a dns packet and then call the resolver
to send it. 

The library is asynchronise (thanks to Go) from the get go.

Implemented RFCS:

* RFC2671, EDNS
* RFC1034/1035
* RFC4033/4034/4035 (todo: validation)
* RFC5155 (NSEC)


Loosly based upon:
* ldns
* NSD
* Net::DNS
