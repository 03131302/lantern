Alternative (more granular) approach to a DNS library.

Completely usable DNS library. Most widely used Resource Records are
supported (more to come). DNSSEC types too (except NSEC3, for now).
EDNS0 is (see edns.go), UDP/TCP queries, TSIG, AXFR (and IXFR probably)
too.  Both client and server side programming is supported.

Installation is done by running: ./install

Sample programs can be found in the _examples directory. They can 
be build with: make examples (after the dns package has been installed)

Have fun!

Implemented RFCS:

* RFC 1034/1035
* RFC 2671, EDNS
* RRC 3225, DO bit
* RFC 3110, RSA in DNS  
* RFC 4033/4034/4035 , DNSSEC
* RFC 5001, NSID
* RFC 5155, NSEC3 -- todo
* And all that I forgot

Loosely based upon:
* ldns
* NSD
* Net::DNS
* GRONG
